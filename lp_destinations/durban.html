          <div><p>Stretching along a swathe of butter-yellow sand, South Africa’s third-largest city offers a lively, if slightly tacky, prepackaged seaside holiday. The beachfront, with its multi-km stretch of high-rise hotels and snack bars, remains a city trademark, and the city centre, peppered with some grandiose colonial buildings and fascinating Art Deco architecture, throbs to a distinctly African beat. Home to the largest concentration of people of Indian descent in the country, Durban also boasts the sights, sounds and scents of the subcontinent. While the beachfront is still a favourite spot, many visitors, wary of the city’s increasing reputation for crime, base themselves in the suburbs, which are chock-a-block with accommodation, shopping malls, funky bars and stylish eateries.</p></div>

<p>The Airport Shuttle Bus (465 1660) departs the airport regularly to the beach and city centre’s major hotels (US$4). Some hostels run their own taxi shuttle services. The main bus terminal and information centre for inner-city and metropolitan buses is on Commercial Rd. Durban Transport (309 5942) runs the bus services Mynah and Aqualine. Mynah covers most of the beachfront and central residential areas. Trips cost around US$0.40. The larger Aqualine buses run through the outer-lying Durban metropolitan area.A taxi between the beach and Florida Rd, Morningside costs about US$4.</p>
<p>Durban International Airport is off the N2, 18km south of the city. Several airlines link Durban with South Africa’s main centres. The popular and useful Baz Bus (304 9099; www.bazbus.com; 1st fl, Tourist Junction; 8.30am-4.30pm Mon-Fri, 8.30am-noon Sat) has an office next to Durban Africa. Long-distance buses leave from the bus stations near the Durban train station. It’s safest to enter from NMR Ave, not Umgeni Rd. All of the major companies have daily departures to Jo’burg (US$26 to US$30, eight hours), Cape Town (US$63, 22 to 27 hours), Port Elizabeth (US$44, 15 hours) and Pietermaritzburg (US$12, one hour), among other destinations. Buses also run to Gaborone (via Jo’burg; US$47, 15½ hours) and Maputo (via Jo’burg; US$31, 15 hours). Some long-distance minibus taxis running mainly to the south coast and the Wild Coast region of Eastern Cape leave from around the Berea train station. To Jo’burg it costs US$18. The areas in and around the minibus taxis’ ranks are unsafe and extreme care should be taken if entering them. Durban train station (0860-008 888) is huge. Use the NMR Ave entrance, 1st level. Even hardy travellers report feeling unsafe on the local inner-city and suburban trains. Long-distance services are another matter – they are efficient and arranged into separate male and female sleeper compartments for Jo’burg (1st/2nd class US$34/22, 12½ hours).</p>
